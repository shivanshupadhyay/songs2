    <h2>Believer - Imagine Dragons</h2>
    <img src="imagine%20dragon.jpg" alt="imagine dragons cover image">
    <p class="beta">First things first<br>
I'mma say all the words inside my head<br>
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
The way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
        <br><br>
Second things second<br>
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
The master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
<br><br>
I was broken from a young age<br>
Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
Writing my poems for the few<br>
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
Taking my message from the veins<br>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
Seeing the beauty through the...<br>
<br><br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
<br><br>
Third things third<br>
Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
All the hate that you've heard has turned your<br>
spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br>
Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br>
<br><br>
I was choking in the crowd<br>
Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down<br>
And rained down, like...<br>
<br><br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
<br><br>
Last things last<br>
By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down<br>
And rained down, like...<br>
<br><br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br> </p>

    <h2>On my way by Alan walker</h2>
    <img src="onmyway.jpg" alt="on my way cover image">
    <p class="gamma">I'm sorry but<br>
Don't wanna talk<br>
I need a moment before I go<br>
It's nothing personal<br>
<br><br>
I draw the blinds<br>
They don't need to see me cry<br>
'Cause even if they understand<br>
They don't understand<br>
<br><br>
So then when I'm finished<br>
I'm all 'bout my business<br>
And ready to save the world<br>
I'm taking my misery<br>
Make it my bitch<br>
Can't be everyone's favorite girl<br>
<br><br>
So take aim and fire away<br>
I've never been so wide awake<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
The blood moon is on the rise<br>
The fire burning in my eyes<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
<br><br>
[Farruko:]<br>
(Ya, ya)<br>
(Farru, yeah, guaya)<br>
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)<br>
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)<br>
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano<br><br>
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano<br>
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano<br>
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)<br>
<br><br>
Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)<br>
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)<br>
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti<br>
<br><br>
[Sabrina Carpenter:]<br>
So take aim and fire away<br>
I've never been so wide awake<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)<br>
The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes)<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way<br>
<br><br>
[Farruko:]<br>
(I'm on my way)<br>
[Sabrina Carpenter:]<br>
Everybody, everybody keep me safe<br>
Everybody, everybody keep me safe<br>
Everybody, everybody keep me safe<br>
Everybody, everybody keep me safe<br>
Everybody, everybody on my way<br>
<br><br>
So take aim and fire away<br>
I've never been so wide awake<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
The blood moon is on the rise<br>
The fire burning in my eyes<br>
No, nobody but me can keep me safe<br>
And I'm on my way<br></p>
